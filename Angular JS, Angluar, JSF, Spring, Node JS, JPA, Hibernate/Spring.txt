- In order to over come from the problems of tight coupling between objects, spring framework uses dependency injection mechanism with the help of POJO model and through dependency injection its possible to achieve loose coupling.

- Define spring framework?
The Spring Framework is a open source application framework for the Java platform

- What are Java beans?
JavaBeans are classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean). They are serializable, have a zero-argument constructor, and allow access to properties using getter and setter methods.
