Object and Class

Inheritance

why java don't support multiple inheritance and how virtual function of c++ helps to attain it (in case of multiple inheritance how does it remove ambiguity)
see the ambiguity as well in the case of multiple inheritacne in java (java doesn't Supports Multiple Inheritance because of ambiguity error)
1)
class A { 
A(){} 
} 
class B { 
B(){} 
} 

class C implements A, B{ 
C(){ 
super(); // Here Constructor chaining problem 
}}

Abstraction

Encapsulation

Polymorphism - overloading (saving contact in mobile with 2 numbers) and overriding (marry girl example for parent and child)

Access Modifiers

Abstract (example of banks - deposit, withdraw and interest) and Concrete Classes

Interfaces

Abstract Classes v/s Interfaces

Static variable or static method

transient and serialization

volatile data type (come in context with multithreading) v/s synchronised
